# üñêÔ∏è Hand Gesture Controlled 3D-Printed Gripper  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates **real-time hand gesture recognition** using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**, integrated with an **Arduino-controlled 3D-printed robotic gripper**.  
By detecting an **open hand** or **closed fist** through a webcam, the system sends commands to the Arduino, which moves the gripper accordingly.  

This project does not focus on the entire robotic arm or its mechanical design, but specifically on the gripper mechanism and its integration with computer vision for gesture-based control.

## Features  
- **Real-time gesture detection** with OpenCV + MediaPipe  
- **Seamless Arduino integration** via PySerial  
- **3D-printed gripper mechanism** for physical interaction  
- Simple, intuitive **open/close control** with natural hand gestures  
- Modular design ‚Äî can be expanded for full robotic arm control  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (OpenCV, MediaPipe, PySerial)  
- **Arduino IDE** (Servo control)  
- **3D Printing** for gripper components  
- **USB Camera / Laptop Webcam**

## Files Included

- **hand_control_gripper.py** ‚Üí Python script using OpenCV & MediaPipe to detect hand gestures (open/closed) and send corresponding signals to Arduino for controlling the gripper.  
- **openCv_HandGripper.ino** ‚Üí Arduino code for controlling the gripper servo motor based on commands from the Python script.  
- **gesture_open_hand.png** ‚Üí Screenshot showing the system detecting an open hand. Key points on the fingers and palm are marked with red dots, connected by white lines to form a hand skeleton for precise gesture recognition.
- **gesture_closed_fist.png** ‚Üí Screenshot showing the system detecting a closed fist. The same landmark tracking highlights finger and palm positions, enabling accurate recognition of the ‚Äúgrab‚Äù gesture used to control the robotic gripper.
- **closed_Robotic_Gripper.png** ‚Üí Close-up image showing the robotic gripper in a fully closed position, triggered when the user makes a closed-fist gesture.
- **open_gripper_closeup.jpg** ‚Äì Close-up image showing the 3D-printed robotic gripper in an open position, triggered when the user opens their hand in front of the camera.
- **Robotic_arm_prototype.jpg** ‚Üí Full view of the robotic arm prototype with the 3D-printed gripper mounted and wired for testing.

## How It Works  
1. **Webcam captures** the user‚Äôs hand in real-time.  
2. **MediaPipe Hand Tracking** detects 21 hand landmarks.  
3. The **gesture state** (open or closed) is calculated.  
4. **PySerial sends** a single character command (`O` for open, `G` for grab) to Arduino.  
5. Arduino **drives the servo** to open or close the gripper.

## Setup & Usage  

### Arduino Setup  
- Connect your servo to Arduino:
  - **Signal** ‚Üí Pin 9  
  - **VCC** ‚Üí 5V  
  - **GND** ‚Üí GND  
- Upload `openCv_HandGripper.ino` to your Arduino.  

### Python Environment  
conda create -n opencv-env python=3.10
conda activate opencv-env
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyserial

### Run the Script
python hand_control_gripper.py


### Future Improvements
Add more gestures for advanced control (e.g., rotate wrist, partial grip).
Implement voice commands alongside gesture control.
Integrate feedback sensors in the gripper for pressure control.
